🖼️ Project Title: Dynamic Image Slider
📘 Project Overview

The Dynamic Image Slider is a full-stack web application that allows users to upload images dynamically to a cloud server (Cloudinary) and view them as an automatic image slideshow on the website. The project demonstrates the integration of frontend–backend–database–cloud services in a simple yet powerful system.

It’s ideal for photographers, marketers, or businesses that frequently update images — the system automatically displays uploaded images in a smooth carousel without redeploying or reloading the code.

🌟 Key Features

✅ Dynamic Uploads: Upload new images anytime without code changes.
✅ Cloud Storage Integration: Images are stored securely in Cloudinary.
✅ Automatic Slideshow: Frontend slider automatically fetches and displays the latest images.
✅ Responsive Design: Works across desktop and mobile screens.
✅ Backend API: Secure REST API built with Node.js + Express.
✅ Database Integration: All image metadata (URLs, filenames) saved in MongoDB.
✅ Error Handling: Safe image upload and retrieval with validation.

💻 Technologies Used
Frontend:

React.js (with Vite)

Axios (for API calls)

React Slick (for image carousel)

CSS3 (for styling)

Backend:

Node.js

Express.js

Mongoose (MongoDB connection)

Database:

MongoDB Atlas (cloud-hosted NoSQL database)

Cloud Storage:

Cloudinary (for image hosting and CDN delivery)

⚙️ How It Works

User Uploads Image:
The user selects an image file from the browser and uploads it through the frontend form.

Backend Receives Image:
The backend API (Express) receives the image using multer and uploads it to Cloudinary.

Cloudinary Returns URL:
Cloudinary responds with a public URL for the uploaded image.

Database Stores Data:
The backend saves this URL and filename into MongoDB for future reference.

Frontend Displays Slideshow:
React app fetches all image URLs from the backend and displays them dynamically using React Slick.

Auto Update:
When a new image is uploaded, it automatically appears in the slideshow — no manual refresh needed.
